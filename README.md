# Input Logger Simulation (Python)

# Description
This project is a simple input logging simulation built using Python.

It records user input along with timestamps and saves the data into a text file.

Note:
This is an educational simulation for learning purposes only.
It does NOT capture real keyboard activity.

#  Features
- Records user input
- Adds timestamp using datetime module
- Saves data into a file (keylog.txt)
- Stops when user types "exit"

# Technologies Used
- Python
- datetime module
- File handling

# How to Run

Run the script:

python input_logger.py

The logged data will be saved in:
keylog.txt

# Learning Concepts
- While loops
- File handling (append mode)
- datetime module
- String formatting
